        <h3>Fahim</h3>
        <p>Hello everyone! I'm a friendly and very energetic person who's always willing to learn new skills.
          I'm a big technology enthuasiast and I also have a great passion in photo and video editing.
          Throughout my time in college, I've developed many programs that can be used in real life situations
          as well as few platform games which have all been coded using VB.net. This is my first time using Java
        and I hope that throughout my time at City, I'll become a better programmer.</p>
        I created two small projects from what I learnt so far during the coding bootcamp. The first project is what
        I initially started off with and the second project is just a much enhanced version of the first one.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Relaxing and satisfying 2D animation with sound</h3>
    <p>
     This is my first programming project which has been coded using some of the tools
     and techniques that I learnt in the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City (2020). 
     This simple Processing project demonstrates a great understanding
     of the use of sound, colours and movement across the canvas using if statements.
     I created 2 bouncing shapes (one line and two balls) to give life to the project 
     by using the X and Y axis of the canvas as reference points to make them move.
     In addition, if statements were used so that whenever one of the objects touches the
     width or height of the canvas, the objects travels in the opposite direction.
     To ensure that the shapes left trails behind whenever they move around the screen,
     I set a background() function on setup so that the trails stand out on a black background
     and also made sure that it wasn't added on draw so that the background doesn't keep updating
     every time the shapes move.
     Over time, the project should develop multiple rectangles of different colours and size all stacked
     on top of each other as shown in the pictures.

    <h3>Further enhancements to the project</h3>
    <p>
     I enhanced the project by changing couple of values in the setup. First of all, I added another
     set of values for X and Y called "X2" and "Y2". Those values hold completely different numbers from
     the X and Y values that I originally set up for this project. This is because I want the shapes to move
     in a twisting and slower motion, so by having two different X and Y values I'll be able to obtain a much
     nicer looking effect.
     Furthermore, the last change that I made to the code to achieve the effect shown in the picture, was adding
     a scale() function on top of a smooth scaling size called sin().

      <h3>Java Game Project 2021</h3>
      <h4><i>"The Dark Matter"</i></h4>

      <p>
        For my Java project I've been asked to create a 2D game using the City Engine Physics Library. 

        <br><br>

        We had 3 different milestones which required us to produce a game that meets the requirements provided in the project brief. First of all, I made sure to sketch down few ideas before starting to produce a game world where the entities would be interacting. Secondly I searched images on google to get a idea on what theme I should base my game on and once I decided the theme, I started building the platforms, choosing the enemies and the main character.

        <br><br>

        The goal of my game is to collect all the elemental spheres spread around the world and the player has to travel in different dimensions to collect all of them.
        Well, its not as easy as it sounds because there are different types of enemies that will try to prevent you from collecting them. The player has a maximum lives of 5 so be careful when collecting orbs, otherwise its Game Over! There are many challenges that the player needs to face across the different "worlds". Once the player is able to collect all of them, a highscore table will show up showing the player performance and the time taken to complete the whole game. There are also different background songs and wallpapers that change depending on which level the player is currently on.

        <br>

        The movement is pretty simple: A and D to run left and right and SPACE to jump and climb walls.

        <br><br>

        My game has tons of features included in the GUI such as save and load game, pause and resume, new game which restarts the game from the beginning, volume setting options, background theme song changing option, quit button that closes the game and finally a zoom in, zoom out and restore zoom button which can come in handy for all different types of players.

        <br><br>

        I had quite a lot of fun when doing this especially because of the challenges I faced that helped me to have a better and deeper understanding of programming in general. The main challenges which held me back at first were the null pointer errors which held me back for quite a bit but I was able to find a way to get around them thanks to my lecturer.
