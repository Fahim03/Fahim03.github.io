      <h3>Fahim</h3>
      <p>Hello everyone! I'm a friendly and very energetic person who's always willing to learn new skills.
	   I'm a big technology enthuasiast and I also have a great passion in photo and video editing.
	   Throughout my time in college, I've developed many programs that can be used in real life situations
	   as well as few platform games which have all been coded using VB.net. This is my first time using Java
	   and I hope that throughout my time at City, I'll become a better programmer.</p>
       I created two small projects from what I learnt so far during the coding bootcamp. The first project is what
	   I initially started off with and the second project is just a much enhanced version of the first one.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Relaxing and satisfying 2D animation with sound</h3>
    <p>
	This is my first programming project which has been coded using some of the tools
	and techniques that I learnt in the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City (2020). 
	This simple Processing project demonstrates a great understanding
	of the use of sound, colours and movement across the canvas using if statements.
	I created 2 bouncing shapes (one line and two balls) to give life to the project 
	by using the X and Y axis of the canvas as reference points to make them move.
	In addition, if statements were used so that whenever one of the objects touches the
	width or height of the canvas, the objects travels in the opposite direction.
	To ensure that the shapes left trails behind whenever they move around the screen,
	I set a background() function on setup so that the trails stand out on a black background
	and also made sure that it wasn't added on draw so that the background doesn't keep updating
	every time the shapes move.
	Over time, the project should develop multiple rectangles of different colours and size all stacked
	on top of each other as shown in the pictures.

    <h3>Further enhancements to the project</h3>
    <p>
	I enhanced the project by changing couple of values in the setup. First of all, I added another
	set of values for X and Y called "X2" and "Y2". Those values hold completely different numbers from
	the X and Y values that I originally set up for this project. This is because I want the shapes to move
	in a twisting and slower motion, so by having two different X and Y values I'll be able to obtain a much
	nicer looking effect.
	Furthermore, the last change that I made to the code to achieve the effect shown in the picture, was adding
	a scale() function on top of a smooth scaling size called sin().
